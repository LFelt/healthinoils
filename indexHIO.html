        <div class='info'>
            <p>Believing in the bodyâ€™s innate ability to heal its self, I set off to find what I considered to be the
                purest, gentlest, and most effective ways to aid the body in functioning at peak levels. Essential oils
                have long been used throughout the world, dating back as far as 3,500 BC, for health, cosmetics, and
                religious ceremonies. While the methods of extraction and purity have improved greatly, the efficiency
                and healing properties have remained the same.
                While CBD has come into the spotlight only recently, it too has been used for thousands of years. CBD,
                or hemp, has been integral to the formation of our country. A first draft of the Declaration of
                Independence was written on hemp paper! Both CBD and essential oils are safe and gentle methods to help
                usher the body into balanced wellness. </p>
            <p>Jade Bloom essential oils are handmade in small batches, consciously created using only natural
                ingredients. They are committed to creating the highest quality products without price gouging, as many
                of the other oil brands do. With ingredients straight from nature and a finely hones system of
                purification and extraction, these oils are accessible to everyone.
                CTFO CBD products have been specifically formulated using botanical science to provide hydrophilic extra
                strength potency to provide extra strength relief and effectiveness.
                From immune support to facial care to deodorant to bath bombs to extra strength pain relief, Jade Bloom
                and CFTO are sure to have the high-quality natural products you are looking for. </p>
